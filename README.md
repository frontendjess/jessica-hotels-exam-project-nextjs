Extra features I have added:

- On the homepage hero section there are 3 city links as a design feature, you can hover your mouse (using React useState) and extra information regarding that city and the curated hotels will appear on onmouseenter and dissapear on onmouseleave.
- There is a hotel search form on the homepage hero section as well as the specific hotels pages.
- Datepicker in the search form.
- There is a design feature of "Always at Holidaze" showing the sustainability features of the hotels that can be found in all the curated hotels of Holidaze - using Fontawesome icons.
- The design and branding was a big part of my feature, as I wanted to create a concept that followed through of innovation, sustainability, authenticity and comfort.
- Logo was created in Canva and prototype was created in Figma.
